# 📊 SQL Sample Database

Welcome to the **SQL Sample Database** repository! This project provides a comprehensive example of a relational database structure, ideal for learning and practicing SQL queries, database normalization, data analysis, and more.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository includes:
- **SQL Scripts** for creating and populating the database.
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for understanding the schema.
- **Sample Queries** to demonstrate common SQL operations.

## 🗃️ Database Overview

The sample database simulates a **retail management system** with the following key entities:
- `Customers`
- `Employees`
- `Offices`
- `Orders`
- `OrderDetails`
- `Products`
- `ProductLines`
- `Payments`

### ERD Preview

> An ERD is included in the repository for better understanding of the relationships between tables.

## 🔧 Getting Started

To set up the database locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Spamziesagcan/SQL-Sample-Database.git
   cd SQL-Sample-Database
2. Use any SQL-compatible database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) to execute the SQL script:

3. Open your SQL tool of choice.

4. Execute sample_database.sql to create and populate the database.

5. Start querying! Sample queries are included in the sample_queries.sql file.
